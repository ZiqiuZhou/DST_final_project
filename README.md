# DST_final_project
The code is based on the repository: https://github.com/pvlachas/RNN-RC-Chaos. Please refer this repo for code requirements. Please also read the paper "data-driven forecasting of high-dimensional chaotic systems with long-short term memory networks" (also added in the repo) to get familiar with the ideas.

- Update Ziqiu:
1. already embedded PSC.py code into several files and implemented what PSC.py want us to calculate, see commit changes
2. add "smoothing_sigma" and "cutoff" as hyper-parameters when run .bash script
3. besides figures the origin code provides, I add spectrum_compare, see figure "spectrum_comparison_{}.png" (forget to use plt.legend(), so the labels is not visible) and print "POWER SPECTRUM ERROR" for each experiment
4. next step would be continuously fine-tune parameters

- Update Christoph:

1. Task 1 already finished (but could also be made more detailed...)
